Using stable baselines3 and gym_anytrading

My code following a udemy course about a simple trading bot. Sadly I was not able to use an LSTM model as they had been removed from stable_baselines3 and I was unable to get stable_baselines working. I predict that using a better model type as well as different columns from the larger dataframe we'd see much better results. I also used a normal LSTM to automate trading without much trading logic, just to see if it would stay afloat. it did.
